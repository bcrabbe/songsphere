                        <h2> Introdution </h2>
                        <p>The idea of this website is to provide a quick, easy and communal platform for music blogging. Users can create an account and start writing articles about whatever they like. Each author will have a page like the index displaying their pieces.
                        </p>
                        <p> Inspired by platforms like instagram, authors are encouraged to tag their work to make them searchable for other users. This way someone looking for a type of music can search all the posts using the tag filter form in the top bar.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        <h2> InkScape </h2>
                        <p> After settling on the name SongSphere, one of the first things I did was trying to create an icon for the site. I wanted to have something that related to the name, my first thoughts were to combine waveforms and and spheres. I searched google for inspiration and found this site</p>
                        <a class="indent" href="http://airtightinteractive.com/demos/js/reactive/">http://airtightinteractive.com/demos/js/reactive/</a>
                        <p> I took some screen shots which I imported to InkScape and used the tracer options to vectorise. You can see these below: </p>
                        
                        <img src="iconScreenShot1.png"/><img src="logoBig.svg"/>
                        </br>
                        </br>                        <img src="iconScreenShot2.png"/><img src="logoSmall.svg"/>
                        </br>
                        </br>

                         <p> I was quite quite pleased with how the first one of these looked, but when It came to embedding it in the navigation bar at 30 x 30 px it just looked a mess, to0 small, too much detail. So I went back and went for something simpler. I took inspiration from the logos of chrome and Spotify, something that is clear and somewhat memorable. To make it match the name I kept things circular and tried to create the illusion of a sphere in the central ring using a gradient. I added a thin black stroke to each layer which made the image stand out more.  </p>
                         
                         <img src="logoCirc.svg" height="300" width="300"/>
                         
                         </br>
                         </br>
                         
                         <h2> Gimp/Photoshop </h2>
                         <p> Although I did not find a use for any custom made pngs on this site I do have some experience with both of these programs. When I was younger I studied art and graphic design at GCSE and  photography at AS. I was particularly interested in digital art. I made many 'space scapes' and abstract fractal artworks in Photoshop. The only example I can find that has survived a hdd disaster at some time inbetween is this</p>
                         
                         <a href="http://kalamist.deviantart.com/art/world-wide-worpage-30504212
                             "><img src="http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs10/f/2006/076/0/e/World_wide_worpage_2.jpg"/></a>
                         </br>
                         </br>
                         <p> More recently I made some graphics for our game in the group project unit (BASH defender, the tower defense game). I didn't have photoshop on my computer so I tried using gimp, however I found it difficult to get to grips with and resorted to investing in photoshop. The first thing I created was a background map for the enemies to pass through:</p>
                          <img src="map1.png"/>
                          </br>
                          </br>
                          <p> To create this I googled for " photoshop pattern circuit board" and found <a href="http://sdwhaven.deviantart.com/art/Circuit-Board-Photoshop-Patterns-281225810"> these</a>. Which I applied to get the circuit board designs. I then layered over them some brush strokes using a brush pack I downloaded. I set these layers' blendmodes to 'overlay' and 'soft light' to give some texture and shading in areas. I then applied some layer effects: drop shadows, inner and outer glows to get the separation between the path and the walls. I then applied a number of filter layers: color balance, vibrance, curves and Brightness/Contrast to play with the colors and tones.
                          </p>
                          </br>
                          </br>
                          <p> I also created a some sprite sheets of enemies:</p>
                          <img src="ENEMY_CHAR.png"/>
                          <img src="ENEMY_INT.png"/>
                          <p> We had decided to use a "virus" themed enemy, I started googling for images of viruses for enemies and played with a few things but nothing great came. Then I tried searching for ameoba and found this:
                          </p>
                          <img width=1000 src="http://th05.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2012/282/0/b/amoeba_by_monkeyshack-d5hd4kt.png"/>   </br>
                          </br>
                          <p>Which was perfect. I trimed as much of the background as I could using a large soft edged eraser. I knew that for the sprite to animate properly the guy would have to be placed precisely in the centre a whole number of times, to acheive this I sectioned up the canvas with alternating black and white panels of exactly the right width, then I used a guide(see right most panel below) which fitted to each section with a hole in the middle where the guy should go. For each panel I took a block of random chars/ints placed it over the top of the guy with an overlay blend mode. Using the magic wand tool and the cicular guide, I selected that area and applied a filter>distort>sphereize effect to create the illusion of 3D. For each tile I rotated the base image slightly, expanded (and then shrunk back to make a loop) it slightly to create a more life like effect. I also adjusted the text that was spherized each tile slightly to create the effect of the charecters scrolling around the sphere. Finally I set the colours using a color balance filter layer. </p>

                          <h2>WebSite </h2>
                          <p>I wanted the site to look as professional and stylish as possible. I decided the best way to achieve this was through frameworks. I looked into Bootstrap, Zurb Foundation and uikit, eventually settling for Bootstrap since, being a beginer, the vast number of tutorials based on this framework would be helpful. I read through the pages on <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">getbootstrap.com</a> to get the feel of it.
                          </p>
                          <p> The first thing I add was the navigation bar, I started from <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/examples/starter-template/"> this template</a>. Inspired by facebooks navbar I added a subtle gradient to the background in css. I generated the gradient using <a href="http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/">this tool</a>. I added borders fiting with the logo colour sceme to the top and bottom. I added my logo, this took some time to work out the correct placement to have it appear correctly in both the expanded and collapsed forms.
                          </p>
                          <p> I wanted vistors to see a wide selection of articles, before filtering to their tastes. Inspired by <a href="http://crackmagazine.net/"> this </a> site I thought the best way to acieve this was through a mosaic style tiling. I found <a href="http://masonry.desandro.com/"> this</a> library called masonry and later another which contained it: <a href="http://isotope.metafizzy.co/"> Isotope</a>. Working from the guides on that page I built this js module to control the layout:
                          </p>
                          <pre>
                              function buildMyIsotopeModule($container)
                              {
                                  var $isotopeContainer = $container;
                                  $isotopeContainer.imagesLoaded(initIsotope());
                                  
                                  return { repeatLayout: repeatLayout };
                              
                                  function initIsotope() {
                                      // init
                                      $container.isotope({
                                      itemSelector: '.content-preview',
                                      layoutMode: 'masonry'
                                      });
                                  }
                                  
                                  function repeatLayout() {
                                    $isotopeContainer.isotope('layout');
                                  }
                              }
                          </pre>
                          <p>Initially It didn't work properly because it was arranging them before the widgits had loaded and caused the size to change. I found the library <a href="http://imagesloaded.desandro.com/"> imagesloaded</a> useful for making isotope wait before arranging the tiles. I decided to use JQuery since I read it was well suited to the kind of site I wanted to make, also I have seen some job adverts looking for JQuery experience. I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELRNFtFxIs8"> this (youtube: Zero to Hero with jQuery)</a> video tutorial which gave me a thoughough introduction to it.
                          </p>
                          <p>I wanted users to be able to filter the articles using the the filter bar, and also by clicking the tags attached on any of the articles. I added data-* tags to each of the preview tiles, to facilitate this, however, after researching the options I think it will be best done through the server since there will need to be some database of articles to search on. </p>
                          <p> A full article display can be viewed by clicking the read button on index. Using bootstraps grid system I have added a collapsing column to the right of the article which contains other posts from the author. I added a comment section to bottom of the page which I took from <a href="http://ironsummitmedia.github.io/startbootstrap-blog-post/"> here </a> and customised. The other pages were created from bootstrap form tutorials, these are self validating.
                          </p>
                          <h2>Testing</h2>
                          <p> I have tested my site in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. I havn't been able to test in IE since I have been working from my mac and the IE tab addon for Firefox is not supported. I have run my pages through totalValidator, the only errors come from the embeded player links, which theres not a lot I can do about since authors will add these them selves, and from the line in you template setting c="UTF-8" which you told us should be exact.
                          </p>
